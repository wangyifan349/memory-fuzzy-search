## 1. Similarity and Distance Metrics

### 1.1 Cosine Similarity

#### Introduction

Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors in an inner product space. It is a measure of how similar the two vectors are, focusing on the direction rather than magnitude.

#### Mathematical Formulation

Given two vectors \( \mathbf{A} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \):

\[
\text{Cosine Similarity} = \cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{\|\mathbf{A}\|_2 \times \|\mathbf{B}\|_2}
\]

Where:

- \( \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} \) is the dot product of vectors \( \mathbf{A} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \).
- \( \|\mathbf{A}\|_2 \) is the Euclidean norm (L2 norm) of vector \( \mathbf{A} \).

#### Computational Logic

1. Compute the dot product of the two vectors.
2. Compute the L2 norms of each vector.
3. Divide the dot product by the product of the norms.
4. Ensure that neither of the norms is zero to avoid division by zero.

#### Usage and Applications

- Measuring text similarity in natural language processing.
- Recommendation systems in collaborative filtering.
- Clustering and classification in machine learning.

#### Code

```python
def cosine_similarity(vec1, vec2):
    import numpy as np
    vec1 = np.array(vec1)  # Convert list to NumPy array
    vec2 = np.array(vec2)  # Convert list to NumPy array
    dot_product = np.dot(vec1, vec2)  # Compute dot product
    norm1 = np.linalg.norm(vec1)  # Compute L2 norm of vec1
    norm2 = np.linalg.norm(vec2)  # Compute L2 norm of vec2
    if norm1 == 0 or norm2 == 0:
        return 0.0  # Return 0 if either vector is zero
    return dot_product / (norm1 * norm2)  # Compute cosine similarity
```

#### Example Usage

```python
vec1 = [1, 2, 3]
vec2 = [4, 5, 6]
similarity = cosine_similarity(vec1, vec2)
print("Cosine Similarity:", similarity)
```

**Output:**

```
Cosine Similarity: 0.9746318461970762
```

### 1.2 Dot Product

#### Introduction

The dot product (also known as the scalar product) is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers and returns a single number. It reflects the degree to which two vectors point in the same direction.

#### Mathematical Formulation

Given two vectors \( \mathbf{A} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \):

\[
\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i B_i
\]

#### Computational Logic

1. Multiply corresponding elements of the two vectors.
2. Sum all the products to get the scalar value.

#### Usage and Applications

- Calculating projections in physics.
- Determining the angle between two vectors.
- Neural networks and machine learning algorithms.

#### Code

```python
def dot_product(vec1, vec2):
    import numpy as np
    vec1 = np.array(vec1)
    vec2 = np.array(vec2)
    product = np.dot(vec1, vec2)
    return product
```

#### Example Usage

```python
vec1 = [1, 2, 3]
vec2 = [4, 5, 6]
product = dot_product(vec1, vec2)
print("Dot Product:", product)
```

**Output:**

```
Dot Product: 32
```

## 2. String Algorithms

### 2.1 Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

#### Introduction

The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is to find the longest subsequence common to two sequences. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order but not necessarily contiguous.

#### Mathematical Formulation

Given sequences \( X \) and \( Y \), the length of their LCS is defined by:

\[
LCS(i, j) = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS(i-1, j-1) + 1 & \text{if } X_i = Y_j \\
\max(LCS(i-1, j), LCS(i, j-1)) & \text{if } X_i \ne Y_j
\end{cases}
\]

#### Computational Logic

1. Create a 2D array \( dp \) of size \( (m+1) \times (n+1) \).
2. Initialize the first row and first column with zeros.
3. Fill \( dp \) using the above recurrence relation.
4. The length of LCS is \( dp[m][n] \).

#### Usage and Applications

- Diff tools for comparing files.
- Bioinformatics for DNA sequence analysis.
- Version control systems.

#### Code

```python
def longest_common_subsequence(s1, s2):
    m = len(s1)
    n = len(s2)
    dp = []
    for i in range(m + 1):
        dp_row = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            dp_row.append(0)
        dp.append(dp_row)
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1  # Characters match
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])  # Take max of left and top cell
    return dp[m][n]
```

#### Example Usage

```python
s1 = "AGGTAB"
s2 = "GXTXAYB"
length = longest_common_subsequence(s1, s2)
print("Length of Longest Common Subsequence:", length)
```

**Output:**

```
Length of Longest Common Subsequence: 4
```

### 2.2 Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance)

#### Introduction

Edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two strings are by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other.

#### Mathematical Formulation

Given strings \( S \) and \( T \), the edit distance \( D(i, j) \) is defined as:

\[
D(i, j) = \begin{cases}
i & \text{if } j = 0 \\
j & \text{if } i = 0 \\
\min \begin{cases}
D(i - 1, j) + 1 \\
D(i, j - 1) + 1 \\
D(i - 1, j - 1) + cost
\end{cases} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Where \( cost = 0 \) if \( S_i = T_j \), else \( cost = 1 \).

#### Computational Logic

1. Create a matrix \( dp \) of size \( (m+1) \times (n+1) \).
2. Initialize the first row and first column.
3. Fill in the matrix using the recurrence relation.
4. The edit distance is \( dp[m][n] \).

#### Usage and Applications

- Spell checking.
- DNA sequence analysis.
- Plagiarism detection.

#### Code

```python
def edit_distance(s1, s2):
    m = len(s1)
    n = len(s2)
    dp = []
    for i in range(m + 1):
        dp_row = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            dp_row.append(0)
        dp.append(dp_row)
    for i in range(m + 1):
        dp[i][0] = i  # Deletion
    for j in range(n + 1):
        dp[0][j] = j  # Insertion
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            cost = 0 if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1] else 1  # Substitution cost
            dp[i][j] = min(
                dp[i - 1][j] + 1,       # Deletion
                dp[i][j - 1] + 1,       # Insertion
                dp[i - 1][j - 1] + cost   # Substitution
            )
    return dp[m][n]
```

#### Example Usage

```python
s1 = "kitten"
s2 = "sitting"
distance = edit_distance(s1, s2)
print("Edit Distance:", distance)
```

**Output:**

```
Edit Distance: 3
```

## 3. Fibonacci Sequence

### 3.1 Recursive Version

#### Introduction

The Fibonacci sequence is a series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The recursive version is straightforward but inefficient for large n due to repeated calculations.

#### Mathematical Formulation

\[
F(n) = \begin{cases}
n & \text{if } n = 0 \text{ or } n = 1 \\
F(n-1) + F(n-2) & \text{if } n > 1
\end{cases}
\]

#### Computational Logic

- Base cases: return \( n \) if \( n = 0 \) or \( n = 1 \).
- Recursive call: \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \).

#### Code

```python
def fibonacci_recursive(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n  # Base cases
    result = fibonacci_recursive(n - 1) + fibonacci_recursive(n - 2)  # Recursive calls
    return result
```

#### Example Usage

```python
n = 10
fib_number = fibonacci_recursive(n)
print(f"Fibonacci number at position {n} (Recursive):", fib_number)
```

**Output:**

```
Fibonacci number at position 10 (Recursive): 55
```

---

### 3.2 Dynamic Programming Version

#### Introduction

Using dynamic programming, we store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations, making it efficient for large n.

#### Computational Logic

- Initialize an array \( fib \) with \( fib[0] = 0 \) and \( fib[1] = 1 \).
- Iterate from 2 to n, computing \( fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2] \).

#### Code

```python
def fibonacci_dp(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n  # Base case
    fib = []
    for i in range(n + 1):
        fib.append(0)
    fib[1] = 1  # Seed values
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]  # Compute Fibonacci number
    return fib[n]
```

#### Example Usage

```python
n = 10
fib_number = fibonacci_dp(n)
print(f"Fibonacci number at position {n} (DP):", fib_number)
```

**Output:**

```
Fibonacci number at position 10 (DP): 55
```
